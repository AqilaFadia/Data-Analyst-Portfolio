# Data Analyst Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! This repository showcases my skills in data cleaning, data wrangling, exploration, and visualization using various tools. Through several case studies using open-source datasets, I demonstrate my ability to derive insights and present data in a meaningful way.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL
- **Libraries/Packages**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Looker Studio
- **Others**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Visual Studio Code

## Data Sources
- **Dataset 1**: [Kaggle - Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
- **Dataset 2**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Customer Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

# Case Study 1: Sales Analysis

In this case study, I analyzed the sales data to identify key trends and factors affecting revenue. Using data cleaning, wrangling, and EDA techniques, I identified that the East region contributed the highest sales during Q4 of the fiscal year.

- **Objective**: To analyze the sales performance across different regions.
- **Techniques**: Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, EDA
- **Outcome**: Identified the East region as the top-performing sales region with a 15% increase in sales during Q4.
